# Art_Tools
Some art tools I have built.  The main purpose of this tool is to help me know what to draw when I can't think of anything. It also helps identify practice exercise to hone my skills in drawing.To use these tools you will need to have python 3.7.2 or higher installed.


## Tool Options

- Practice: Not fully developed -- Coming soon
- Draw -- Having a hard time coming up with things to draw this is the tool for you. With the given lists it will display random things to draw.
    - Environment Generator -- Program will randomly select options from the Environments list.
    - Item Generator -- Program will randomly select how many items you tell it from the items list.
    - Character Generator -- Program will generate a random character based on these three criteria
        - Shapes (Basic shapes to use while constructing the character.)
        - Physical Nature (Male, Female, Cat, Dog, etc...)
        - distinguishing characteristic (Warlock, Cowboy, Bookworm, etc...)
    - Scene builder -- Program generates a random scene from each of the items above.
    - Edit lists -- Edit the lists the program pulls from with this option.
    

- clone repo
- execute `__main__.py` via terminal (`python <cloned folder>\Art_Tools\__main__.py`)
--Note: It generates based on cwd so you need to change terminal directory to Art_Tools location for script to run properly
